Data types in JS :- v

-Datatypes is an attribytes associated with abpiece of data that tells a computer system how to interpriet its value.
In data types we used "typeof" operator to know that what type of data it is.
-Mainly in javascript their are 2 types of data types.

1.Primitive :-
-In javascript there are 7 types of primitive datatypes are present.
1.Number :-Number are the type of data types those it contain some numerical value.
2.Boolean :-In Boolean data types we get boolean value like true & false.
3.Undefiend :-In Undefiend data types the data is not define so that it will show undefiend.
4.Null :-In this data type we get null for the value means nothing.
5.Bigint :-In bigint we will get big integer value.
6.String :-String is a type of data type that can hold some charecter like names or words.
7.Symbol :-In symbol we will get whole symbol as well as the value we get for the data type.
2.Reference or Non-primitive data type :-
-Non-primitive data types are the type of data type that can hold multiple items in a single time.
-Non-primitive data types are - object,array,funvtion
-Objects in a non primitive datatype which can hold multiple of item in one single entity.
-Mainly objects are working on (key:value)pair.
-the left hand side is our keys and right hand side are the values of that key.

ex.

person = {
    "name" : "web-bocket",
    "age" : 2,
    "business" : "software",
    "carrier" : "good"

}
great()

if(condition){
    statement
} else {
    statement
}

3. else-if condition :-
-
-its check the condition multiple times where the condition
